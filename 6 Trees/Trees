Types:

full or strict binary tree: all nodes have either zero or two child.

perfact binary tree: internal nodes have 2 child + all leaf nodes are on same level.

complete binary tree: all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level + last level must have its keys as left as possible.

degenerate tree: Every parent node has exactly one child.

skewed trees: all child are in left side then its left skewed. and if all child are in right side then right skewed tree.


-->Representation of a binary tree
-array representation
-linked representation

-->types of traversal:
-inorder    --> Left, Root, Right
-preorder   --> Root , left, Right
-postorder  --> Left, Right, Root

-->BST
-type of binary tree.
-all nodes of left subtree are lesser.
-all nodes of right subtree are greater.
-left and right subtrees are also BST.
-there are no duplicate nodes.
*- inorder traversal of BST give an ascending sorted array.
