1.1	Classify various data structures

Classification of Data Structures:

Data structures can be classified as 

1.	Primitive data structure 
2.	Non-Primitive data structure 
(a)	Linear data structure 
(b)	Non-linear data structure

1.	Primitive data structures: Primitive data structures are simple data structures constructed using the standard data types of a computer language. Examples of primitive data structures include variables, arrays, pointers, structures, unions, and more. These structures are used to build more complex data structures

2.	Non-primitive data structures: Non-primitive data structures are constructed using primitive data structures and have specific functionality. They can be designed by a user and are classified into two categories: linear data structures and non-linear data structures.

(a)	Linear data structures 

Linear data structures are arranged as a continuous set of data elements in the memory and can be constructed using array data types. In linear data structures, the adjacency relationship between data elements is maintained.
	
Operations applied on linear data structure: 

The following list of operations applied on linear data structures

	Add an element
	Delete an element
	Traverse
	Sort the list of elements
	Search for a data element

Examples of linear data structure

	Stack 
	Queue
	Tables
	List
	Linked Lists. 


(b)	Non-linear Data Structure: 

Non-linear data structures are not arranged in a continuous manner and include data structures such as trees and graphs. These structures can be used to represent complex relationships between data elements.

Operations applied on non-linear data structures:

The following list of operations applied on non-linear data structures. 

	Add elements
	Delete elements
	Display the elements
	Sort the list of elements
	Search for a data element 

Examples of non-linear data structure

	Tree
	Decision tree
	Graph
	Forest
