1.5 Identify widely used application which use stack data structure for implementation of its important feature.

Stack Applications:

1.	Stack is used by compilers to check for balancing of parentheses, brackets and braces.
2.	Stack is used to evaluate a postfix expression.
3.	Stack is used to convert an infix expression into postfix/prefix form.
4.	In recursion, all intermediate arguments and return values are stored on the processorâ€™s stack.
5.	During a function call the return address and arguments are pushed onto a stack and on return they are popped off.
6.	Depth first search uses a stack data structure to find an element from a graph.
